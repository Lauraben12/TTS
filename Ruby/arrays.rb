#arrays are a collective of data housed within square brackets []
#an array can hold any sort of data typ or even a mix
#items in an array can be called by their index
#arrays have several methods associated with them that let us inspect and modify. use first and last alot
#besides .push and .po non of these modifications are permanent. to make mods stick reassign the variable, using method ending with a !
# .include? (you need question mark) method will return true or false depending on if the searched for item isfound in the array
# .join joins an array and string .split wll split

# hashes are similar to arrays. arrays collect are a collection of data. hases store datat as "key"/"value"
#each "key" & "value" are separated by a hash-rocket =>. hash is contained in curly bracket {}
#arrays and hashes are a way to store things you need to access later. arrays are king for data storage
