#thoug a key can be any data type, it will most commonly be a string or a symbol
#symbols are represented with colons (:)
# normally the colon is in front (:name) but if its pointing to something with a hash rocket we can put the colon on the left and remove the hash rocket.
# watch a video on symbols

#loops
#way to use repetitive code
#in Ruby code blocks are chunks of code that come between the keywords do and end. they check if the condition is true, then perform until it hits a false
# .timesLoop ex 
#3.times do 
#puts "Beetlejuice"
#end
#will return Beetlejuice Beetlejuice Beetlejuice
#you can also use num =4
# num.times do
#puts "something clever"
#end
#loops only take integers. a string has no numerical value 

#until
# an until look a variable incremented or decremented and an action is performed until a certain condition is true
